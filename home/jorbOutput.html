<h3>Tech Lead</h3>
<b>Company: </b>General Things - <a href="http://generalthings.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">generalthings.com</a><br>
<b>Location:</b> <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=1161+Mission+Street,+Suite+410+San+Francisco+CA&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x80858083381a01df:0x82ba2f7fb64cd88f,1161+Mission+St+%23410,+San+Francisco,+CA+94103&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=-3oAUe-OPMKEjALR-IAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ8gEwAA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1161 Mission Street, Suite 410 San Francisco CA</a><br>
<br>
<b>About Us:</b><br>
We're General Things. We've been doing our thing for 10 years now and it's 
pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves (and our customers do too). We're a 
team of developers, designers, and strategists dedicated to helping businesses 
use technology better. We have worked with companies both large and small, 
building everything from microcontroller software for custom devices to 
advanced e-commerce systems. In a nutshell, we help businesses solve 
their technology problems.<br>
<br>
<b>The Role:</b><br>
We're looking for an awesome, fun, smart, hardworking, creative, friendly, responsible 
Tech Lead to effectively help our clients solve their problems as well as to help make a 
great working environment. Your day will consist of tasks like architecting, researching, 
designing, implementing, and testing software; leading software engineering teams; 
teaching and mentoring other engineers; and assisting the client services and business 
development teams with their respective responsibilities. Want more specifics? <br>
<br>
<b>Here are some details of projects you'll work on. You Will:</b><br>
* Participate in the software design process by asking questions, "poking holes," 
offering suggestions, etc.<br>
* Code in a variety of languages, helping us create excellent software<br>
* Test software via automated methods, including writing and running unit tests, 
functional tests, and integration tests, as well as manual methods<br>
* Use visual design, information architecture, and interaction design to assist the 
writing of working software<br>
* Check code into version control <br>
* Refactor old code so it runs faster and more efficiently<br>
* Do People management: coaching, one-on-ones, performance reviews, recruiting, removing impediments<br>
* Play the role of ScrumMaster, depending on team size and composition<br>
* Oversee deployments<br>
* Ensure all production code is adequately reviewed prior to release<br>
* Lead General Education sessions covering architecture and new technologies<br>
<br>
<b>Our Ideal Candidate Has:</b><br>
* At least 10 years of professional experience (or equivalent) programming with more than 
one of the following: PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript, Objective C, AND at least 2 years 
professional experience with Ruby.<br>
* Some exposure to managing a team. You don't need to have tons of direct, 
supervisory experience, but some exposure to leading teams of developers of 
different levels and providing them coaching/feedback/career development is important.<br>
<br>
<b>Extra Credit For:</b><br>
* Backbone.js, Ember.js, Angular.js<br>
* Systems administration experience<br>
* Chef or Puppet<br>
* Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, or other cloud platforms<br>
* Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator<br>
* Though we don't require a college degree, a degree in a related field is always super helpful!<br>
<br>
<b>So what's so great about our gig?  Yeah, we figured you'd ask eventually.  </b><br>
* Good benefits and good salaries. <br>
* Regular downright normal work hours. You heard right - have a life outside of work, we encourage it!<br>
* Continuous on-the-job learning and training, as we all know we can be teachers about one subject and students about another.<br>
* Own the projects you work on. Grab the reins and take control.   <br>
* Sunny, dog friendly office that's centrally located.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we're not out there trying to be the next big flashy thing. Our 
customers like us and we've built our business strictly by their great referrals over the 
last decade. No flash in the pan here - just a great team of smart people solving 
technology problems for other companies. If what we're offering appeals to you and our 
gig sounds better than the other guys, then you may be just who we need. <br>

<br>
<b>About Us:</b><br>
We're General Things. We've been doing our thing for 10 years now and it's 
pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves (and our customers do too). We're a 
team of developers, designers, and strategists dedicated to helping businesses 
use technology better. We have worked with companies both large and small, 
building everything from microcontroller software for custom devices to 
advanced e-commerce systems. In a nutshell, we help businesses solve 
their technology problems.<br>
<br>
<b>The Role:</b><br>
We're looking for an awesome, fun, smart, hardworking, creative, friendly, responsible 
Tech Lead to effectively help our clients solve their problems as well as to help make a 
great working environment. Your day will consist of tasks like architecting, researching, 
designing, implementing, and testing software; leading software engineering teams; 
teaching and mentoring other engineers; and assisting the client services and business 
development teams with their respective responsibilities. Want more specifics? <br>
<br>
<b>Here are some details of projects you'll work on. You Will:</b><br>
* Participate in the software design process by asking questions, "poking holes," 
offering suggestions, etc.<br>
* Code in a variety of languages, helping us create excellent software<br>
* Test software via automated methods, including writing and running unit tests, 
functional tests, and integration tests, as well as manual methods<br>
* Use visual design, information architecture, and interaction design to assist the 
writing of working software<br>
* Check code into version control <br>
* Refactor old code so it runs faster and more efficiently<br>
* Do People management: coaching, one-on-ones, performance reviews, recruiting, removing impediments<br>
* Play the role of ScrumMaster, depending on team size and composition<br>
* Oversee deployments<br>
* Ensure all production code is adequately reviewed prior to release<br>
* Lead General Education sessions covering architecture and new technologies<br>
<br>
<b>Our Ideal Candidate Has:</b><br>
* At least 10 years of professional experience (or equivalent) programming with more than 
one of the following: PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript, Objective C, AND at least 2 years 
professional experience with Ruby.<br>
* Some exposure to managing a team. You don't need to have tons of direct, 
supervisory experience, but some exposure to leading teams of developers of 
different levels and providing them coaching/feedback/career development is important.<br>
<br>
<b>Extra Credit For:</b><br>
* Backbone.js, Ember.js, Angular.js<br>
* Systems administration experience<br>
* Chef or Puppet<br>
* Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, or other cloud platforms<br>
* Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator<br>
* Though we don't require a college degree, a degree in a related field is always super helpful!<br>
<br>
<b>So what's so great about our gig?  Yeah, we figured you'd ask eventually.  </b><br>
* Good benefits and good salaries. <br>
* Regular downright normal work hours. You heard right - have a life outside of work, we encourage it!<br>
* Continuous on-the-job learning and training, as we all know we can be teachers about one subject and students about another.<br>
* Own the projects you work on. Grab the reins and take control.   <br>
* Sunny, dog friendly office that's centrally located.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we're not out there trying to be the next big flashy thing. Our 
customers like us and we've built our business strictly by their great referrals over the 
last decade. No flash in the pan here - just a great team of smart people solving 
technology problems for other companies. If what we're offering appeals to you and our 
gig sounds better than the other guys, then you may be just who we need. <br>

<br>
<b>About Us:</b><br>
We're General Things. We've been doing our thing for 10 years now and it's 
pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves (and our customers do too). We're a 
team of developers, designers, and strategists dedicated to helping businesses 
use technology better. We have worked with companies both large and small, 
building everything from microcontroller software for custom devices to 
advanced e-commerce systems. In a nutshell, we help businesses solve 
their technology problems.<br>
<br>
<b>The Role:</b><br>
We're looking for an awesome, fun, smart, hardworking, creative, friendly, responsible 
Tech Lead to effectively help our clients solve their problems as well as to help make a 
great working environment. Your day will consist of tasks like architecting, researching, 
designing, implementing, and testing software; leading software engineering teams; 
teaching and mentoring other engineers; and assisting the client services and business 
development teams with their respective responsibilities. Want more specifics? <br>
<br>
<b>Here are some details of projects you'll work on. You Will:</b><br>
* Participate in the software design process by asking questions, "poking holes," 
offering suggestions, etc.<br>
* Code in a variety of languages, helping us create excellent software<br>
* Test software via automated methods, including writing and running unit tests, 
functional tests, and integration tests, as well as manual methods<br>
* Use visual design, information architecture, and interaction design to assist the 
writing of working software<br>
* Check code into version control <br>
* Refactor old code so it runs faster and more efficiently<br>
* Do People management: coaching, one-on-ones, performance reviews, recruiting, removing impediments<br>
* Play the role of ScrumMaster, depending on team size and composition<br>
* Oversee deployments<br>
* Ensure all production code is adequately reviewed prior to release<br>
* Lead General Education sessions covering architecture and new technologies<br>
<br>
<b>Our Ideal Candidate Has:</b><br>
* At least 10 years of professional experience (or equivalent) programming with more than 
one of the following: PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript, Objective C, AND at least 2 years 
professional experience with Ruby.<br>
* Some exposure to managing a team. You don't need to have tons of direct, 
supervisory experience, but some exposure to leading teams of developers of 
different levels and providing them coaching/feedback/career development is important.<br>
<br>
<b>Extra Credit For:</b><br>
* Backbone.js, Ember.js, Angular.js<br>
* Systems administration experience<br>
* Chef or Puppet<br>
* Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, or other cloud platforms<br>
* Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator<br>
* Though we don't require a college degree, a degree in a related field is always super helpful!<br>
<br>
<b>So what's so great about our gig?  Yeah, we figured you'd ask eventually.  </b><br>
* Good benefits and good salaries. <br>
* Regular downright normal work hours. You heard right - have a life outside of work, we encourage it!<br>
* Continuous on-the-job learning and training, as we all know we can be teachers about one subject and students about another.<br>
* Own the projects you work on. Grab the reins and take control.   <br>
* Sunny, dog friendly office that's centrally located.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we're not out there trying to be the next big flashy thing. Our 
customers like us and we've built our business strictly by their great referrals over the 
last decade. No flash in the pan here - just a great team of smart people solving 
technology problems for other companies. If what we're offering appeals to you and our 
gig sounds better than the other guys, then you may be just who we need. <br>

App Security from a Proven Security Expert<br>
Enterprise mobility problems cannot be solved by device management solutions alone--at its core, it is an app data security problem. Since 2004, no one has secured more data in more critical contexts than Mocana, from the smart grid to the surgery room, from the bank to the battlefield. <br>

<h3>Node.js Runtime Agent Hacker (SOMA / south beach)</h3>
	<div><div style="text-align:right"><a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/3901130389.html">Node.js Runtime Agent Hacker (SOMA / south beach)</a></div><br>

		Node.js Runtime Agent Hacker<br>
San Francisco or Portland, OR<br>
<br>
New Relic's Node.js agent is bringing the awesomeness of New Relic to Node developers everywhere, and you can be a part of the fun! You already love Node. You already love the Node community. So imagine spending your days digging into the guts of Node core and working with Node committers to help make Node better and easier to debug. Sounds good, right?<br>
<br>
This job is not for the faint of heart. To be honest, it's going to be really hard. <br>
<br>
To be successful, you must be comfortable describing how Node's event loop works, and you will have at least some idea of where V8 stops and libuv begins. You should have a solid grasp on basic Node performance tuning, and maybe some experience with DTrace and mdb to troubleshoot Node applications. Functional programming and OO chops are expected, and you should be comfortable with functional topics like functional composition and continuation-passing style. <br>
<br>
This is a javascript role. You will be writing loads of JS, but you don't fear debugging C/C++, when needed. New Relic is full of polyglots, so learning Ruby, Java, Python, Go, and other languages excites you. You also like helping people as you will be supporting other developers who may not know how Node works. <br>
<br>
We're a very fast growing pre-IPO start-up and we care about our culture. We value:<br>
<br>
•	Work/Life Balance<br>
•	Respect<br>
•	Engineer Code Ownership<br>
•	Experimentation<br>
<br>
A little about us<br>
<br>
We are passionate, possibly even crazy, about application performance management (APM). Our mission is to make web applications run better, to make the internet more productive, and to make life easier for developers and devops. We are turning the APM marketplace upside down by providing SaaS products that deliver high-value functionality previously only available through enterprise software. We are well above 40,000 customers. And with your help we'll get to 10x that number.<br>
<br>
New Relic is a San Francisco Best Places to Work 2012 award winner, a Top 100 OnDemand Company, Best of SaaS (THINKStrategies), Top 100 Coolest Cloud Computing (CRN); 10 Cloud Management Companies to Watch (NetworkWorld); the list of accolades goes on. More important, we provide challenging work, opportunities to learn, high quality teammates, a standard-setting product, and a company on the move.<br>
<br>
This position is in our Portland, Oregon or San Francisco office, both smack in the middle of vibrant tech communities and a great quality of life. We offer competitive compensation, pre-IPO stock options, and big-company benefits (medical, dental, vision, life), while maintaining the energy, agility, and the fun of a start-up.  We can help with relocation and are open to H1-B transfers.<br>
<br>
New Relic is most decidedly an equal opportunity employer. We seek applicants of diverse background and hire without regard to race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, disability, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law. Note: Our stewardship of the data of many thousands of customers' means that a criminal background check is required to join New Relic. <br>
