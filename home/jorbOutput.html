<h3>UI Engineer (Contract)</h3>
<p><b>Company: </b>Direct Commerce - <a href="http://www.directcommerce.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.directcommerce.com</a><br>
<b>Location:</b> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=735+Montgomery+Street,+Suite+200+San+Francisco,+CA+94111-2108&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gl=us&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">735 Montgomery Street,
Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111</a><br>
<br>
<b>The Company:</b><br>
Direct Commerce (DCI) builds software that automates accounts payable systems.  We provide our customers, 
Fortune 500 companies, custom-tailored solutions that are 100% cloud-based and easy to maintain.  
Our company is a profitable, stable, quickly growing startup bursting at the seams with 
challenging new projects.<br>
<br>
<b>The Role:</b><br>
Direct Commerce is looking for a UI Engineer to take our DCI application and give it a 
facelift. We want it to sport an updated screen layout and lighter color palette. A series 
of HTML screens have already been drawn, so the exact target HTML is already determined. 
We need you to modify the application (which is written in a mixture of JSP/XSLT/Java) so 
that it sports a new look and feel. Some "plumbing" code has already been done, so this 
job mostly entails converting the HTML screens from one to another. The structure of the 
application and links, etc. will fundamentally remain the same, but there will likely be 
some remaining "plumbing" Java or JavaScript code. <br>
<br>
<b>Our Ideal Candidate Knows:</b><br>
* HTML - specifically, experience with DIV tags vs TABLE tags<br>
* JavaScript<br>
* CSS<br>
* Java Server Pages (JSP)<br>
<br>
<b>Nice-To-Haves:</b><br>
* Since most of our app is written in it, the more Java familiarity you have, the better!<br>
* Experience with application servers, especially JBoss<br>
* XSLT - we use XSLT heavily, so this is a big plus<br>
<br>
<b>Perks:</b><br>
* This is a contract role with an opportunity for extension and conversion to full time employee status. <br>
* We have a small team at a small company where you can wear lots of hats and really make a difference.<br>
* This is a contract, on-site position with a competitive rate.<br>
<br>
<b>How To Apply:</b><br>
* <a href="http://www.thesourcery.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Sourcery</a> will be the first point of contact.<br>
* All applications receive a response.<br>
* All applications are kept strictly confidential.<br>

Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111</a><br>
<br>
<b>The Company:</b><br>
Direct Commerce (DCI) builds software that automates accounts payable systems.  We provide our customers, 
Fortune 500 companies, custom-tailored solutions that are 100% cloud-based and easy to maintain.  
Our company is a profitable, stable, quickly growing startup bursting at the seams with 
challenging new projects.<br>
<br>
<b>The Role:</b><br>
Direct Commerce is looking for a UI Engineer to take our DCI application and give it a 
facelift. We want it to sport an updated screen layout and lighter color palette. A series 
of HTML screens have already been drawn, so the exact target HTML is already determined. 
We need you to modify the application (which is written in a mixture of JSP/XSLT/Java) so 
that it sports a new look and feel. Some "plumbing" code has already been done, so this 
job mostly entails converting the HTML screens from one to another. The structure of the 
application and links, etc. will fundamentally remain the same, but there will likely be 
some remaining "plumbing" Java or JavaScript code. <br>
<br>
<b>Our Ideal Candidate Knows:</b><br>
* HTML - specifically, experience with DIV tags vs TABLE tags<br>
* JavaScript<br>
* CSS<br>
* Java Server Pages (JSP)<br>
<br>
<b>Nice-To-Haves:</b><br>
* Since most of our app is written in it, the more Java familiarity you have, the better!<br>
* Experience with application servers, especially JBoss<br>
* XSLT - we use XSLT heavily, so this is a big plus<br>
<br>
<b>Perks:</b><br>
* This is a contract role with an opportunity for extension and conversion to full time employee status. <br>
* We have a small team at a small company where you can wear lots of hats and really make a difference.<br>
* This is a contract, on-site position with a competitive rate.<br>
<br>
<b>How To Apply:</b><br>
* <a href="http://www.thesourcery.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Sourcery</a> will be the first point of contact.<br>

<br>
<b>We're General Things.</b>  We've been doing our thing for 10 years now and it's 
pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves (and our customers do too). We're a team of 
developers, designers, and strategists dedicated to helping businesses use technology 
better. We have worked with companies both large and small, building everything from 
microcontroller software for custom devices to advanced e-commerce systems. In a nut 
shell, we help businesses solve their technology problems. <br>
<br>
<b>We're looking for a Ruby on Rails Engineer and we'll keep it simple (because really, it is):</b><br>
* You have a few years of experience as an object-oriented software engineer. <br>
* You have at least a year or so of experience coding in Ruby on Rails - you're a general or 
senior engineer, and can hit the ground running with us on a RoR project. <br>
* You've had the opportunity to work on some web based applications and want to work on more!  <br>
* You've put code into production before. <br>
* You've used version control and are at least familiar with TDD. If you're a TDD pro - even better.<br>
<br>
<b>Bonus Points For:</b><br>
* Android/Java experience<br>
<br>
<b>So what's so great about our gig?  Yeah, we figured you'd ask eventually.  </b><br>
* Good benefits and good salaries. <br>
* Regular downright normal work hours. You heard right - have a life outside of work, we encourage it!<br>
* We all learn, teach, and train together. Learn something new? Tell us about it. We'll return the favor.<br>
* Own the projects you work on. Grab the reins and take control.   <br>
* Sunny, dog friendly office that's centrally located<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we're not out there trying to be the next big flashy thing. 
Our customers like us and we've built our business strictly by their great referrals 
over the last decade. No flash in the pan here - just a great team of smart people 
solving technology problems for other companies. If what we're offering appeals to 
you and our gig sounds better than the other guys, then you may be just who we need.  <br>

<b>We're General Things.</b>  We've been doing our thing for 10 years now and it's 
pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves (and our customers do too). We're a team of 
developers, designers, and strategists dedicated to helping businesses use technology 
better. We have worked with companies both large and small, building everything from 
microcontroller software for custom devices to advanced e-commerce systems. In a nut 
shell, we help businesses solve their technology problems. <br>

<b>We're looking for a Ruby on Rails Engineer and we'll keep it simple (because really, it is):</b><br>
* You have a few years of experience as an object-oriented software engineer. <br>
* You have at least a year or so of experience coding in Ruby on Rails - you're a general or 
senior engineer, and can hit the ground running with us on a RoR project. <br>

<b>So what's so great about our gig?  Yeah, we figured you'd ask eventually.  </b><br>

* Own the projects you work on. Grab the reins and take control.   <br>
* Sunny, dog friendly office that's centrally located<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we're not out there trying to be the next big flashy thing. 
Our customers like us and we've built our business strictly by their great referrals 
over the last decade. No flash in the pan here - just a great team of smart people 
solving technology problems for other companies. If what we're offering appeals to 
you and our gig sounds better than the other guys, then you may be just who we need.  <br>

We need you to modify the application (which is written in a mixture of JSP/XSLT/Java) so 
that it sports a new look and feel. Some "plumbing" code has already been done, so this 
job mostly entails converting the HTML screens from one to another. The structure of the 
application and links, etc. will fundamentally remain the same, but there will likely be 
some remaining "plumbing" Java or JavaScript code. <br>
<br>
<b>Our Ideal Candidate Knows:</b><br>
* HTML - specifically, experience with DIV tags vs TABLE tags<br>
* JavaScript<br>
* CSS<br>
* Java Server Pages (JSP)<br>
<br>
<b>Nice-To-Haves:</b><br>
* Since most of our app is written in it, the more Java familiarity you have, the better!<br>
* Experience with application servers, especially JBoss<br>
* XSLT - we use XSLT heavily, so this is a big plus<br>
<br>
<b>Perks:</b><br>
* This is a contract role with an opportunity for extension and conversion to full time employee status. <br>
* We have a small team at a small company where you can wear lots of hats and really make a difference.<br>
* This is a contract, on-site position with a competitive rate.<br>
<br>
<b>How To Apply:</b><br>
* <a href="http://www.thesourcery.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Sourcery</a> will be the first point of contact.<br>
* All applications receive a response.<br>
* All applications are kept strictly confidential.<br>
